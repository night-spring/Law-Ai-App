She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\u2019 own property, takes that property out of B\u2019 possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft."}
